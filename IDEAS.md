- make coverer yield partial results instead of always enumerating all possible covers
    - might make hardest puzzles feasible
    - ideally use some way to prioritize "good" covers to increase likelihood of finding it
        - maximize semantic similarity (as defined in SolutionRanker) during covering process
- consider doing spangram finding before full covering?
    - not sure how feasible, enumerating all spangrams might be prohibitively expensive when considering longer (3-4 word) concatenations
- allow shorter words but only if part of spangram (needs perf optimizations to be feasible)
    - makes puzzles which have a spangram consisting of at least one short word possible
